# ScientistAnim

Character Skinning
    Used NGSkinTools to weight paint this character to fit my animation needs and look as realistic as I could make it.

Joint Hierarchy
    This character is a scientist I created for my animation projects.
    I followed standard human joint hierarchy as best I could in creating her.
    I did not have any special considerations when making this character.

Rig Optimization
    Added extra features to rig for usefulness, like Ik system and master scale, and other custom attributes.
