# ScientistAnim

Character Skinning
    Used NGSkinTools to weight paint this character to fit my animation needs and look as realistic as I could make it.

Joint Hierarchy
    This character is a scientist I created for my animation projects.
    I followed standard human joint hierarchy as best I could in creating her.
    I did not have any special considerations when making this character.

Rig Optimization
    Added extra features to rig for usefulness, like Ik system and master scale, and other custom attributes.

Rigging Scripts
    Scripts I made to streamline aspects of character rigging.
        1. A script that adds constraints to a parent group and custom attributes to the control for those constraints.
        2. A script for changing all of the control colors in the selection to a specified colors.
        3. A script for focuing on all of the constraints in the selection, useful for when constraint are applied incorrectly.
